Toy test of cross quantum computation model translation between MBQC patterns (measurement based quantum computing) and quantum circuits.
I am using this code purely for testing and educational purposes, if you find errors in the translations please let me know (I expect there to be many!).
Toffoli gates from circuit -> MBQC are currently broken - I am working on it
